NPA determined with 134 negative clinical Ns specimens collected from symptomatic individuals within 5 days of symptom onset at two undisclosed sites in the United States between late August and early October 2020 (negative determination made using patient-matched NP swabs collected concurrently with the Ns specimens transported in VTM and tested with an undisclosed EUA-authorized RT-PCR assay that includes a solid phase RNA extraction step at an undisclosed central laboratory; negative samples included 10 RT-PCR negative samples from individuals aged 6 to 21 years old, and 116 RT-PCR negative samples from individuals aged 22 to 59 years old, and 8 RT-PCR negative samples from individuals aged 60 years and older). Total and RT-PCR positive samples also stratified separately by days post symptom onset.

Testing was performed by one operator using one lot of the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (Whole Blood/Serum/Plasma). Negative assay results for PPA were those that were negative for both IgG and IgM. *Note that respiratory samples collected from sites in China were both OP swabs (site #1, n = 65) and sputum (site #2, n = 126), but association of positive and negative plasma samples to corresponding respiratory specimen types was not disclosed. Also, the time from RT-PCR result to collection of plasma specimens ranged from 15- 45 days (Site #1) and 0-38 days (Site #2) and the time from collection of specimens (plasma) from each individual to testing ranged from 12-23 days (Site #1) and 3-29 days (Site #2).",
